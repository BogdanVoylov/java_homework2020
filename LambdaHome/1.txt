The person I like the most is my mother. She is one of the most fun-loving people I have ever seen. She is also very smart and independent. But what I like most about her is her helpful nature.

She never ignores an opportunity to help someone in need. She is also very fond of children. My friends also like her. She has a good sense of humor which is often targeted at my father. My father doesn’t mind, though. My grandmother told me once that she used to be a very naughty and willful child and gave her teachers a very hard time.

But as she also got good marks they were not angry with her for long. My mother is a multi-talented person. She can write well, sing and paint. She works as an interior designer and earns a lot of money, a portion of which she spends on charity. Her favorite charities include orphanages and homes for destitute women.

My mother buys a lot of things for me. She buys books, clothes, and she even bought a Persian kitten for me. For this she had to argue with my father for he didn’t want to have pets in the house. But she managed to convince him for she knew that I wanted a pet badly. Sometimes I think that she is still a child at heart.
